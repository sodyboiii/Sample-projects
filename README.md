This is a completed project at math faculty (HSE).

It contains the main class with basic polynomial operations as well as two derivative subclasses (RealPolynomial/QuadraticPolynomial) with specialized root operations.
This program can: add, sub, multiply, find derivatives and value. It can also find roots for Real and Quadratic polynomials.
How to use: can be taken a dict, list or simply integers divided by ', ' as an argument.

I'll be happy with any feedback!
